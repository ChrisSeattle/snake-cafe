Current Features and Goals for our Code:


Previous Features and Goals:

- [x] menu file: name (str), category (str), price (float), and quantity (int) referring to the in-stock amount of that item.
- [ ] alert user if inported file is not .csv file.
- [x] When user adds items to their order, they can also give a quantity, but if no quantity given, assume add 1
- [x] Alert user if they are attempting to order more than we have in stock.
- [x] Alert user if they try to remove or add an item not on current menu
- [x]  Alert user if they try to remove an item they don't have in their order
- [?]  Hide all traceback messages from user, including keyboard interupt

* Old Tests not Done Yet *
