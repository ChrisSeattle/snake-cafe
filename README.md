**Author**: Chris L Chapman
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Create a menu and food ordering program to help learn some Python.

###Features:

- When run, the program should print an intro message and the menu for the restaurant.

- The restaurantâ€™s menu should include appetizers, entrees, desserts, sides, and beverages. At least 6 in each category

- The program should prompt the user for an order

- [x]  All input should be case-insensitive

- When a user enters an item, the program should print an acknowledgment of their input

- The program should tell the user how to exit

- When user types "order", their current entire order is listed

- If user types "menu", reprint the entire menu

- If user types any category name, print items in that category

- Each item has a price

- We are able to get the user's total order cost for all items added

- Sales tax (stored in constant) is computed and displayed for the user

- [Not done]  Every order gets a universally unique identifier

- [Not done] User can remove 1 item they had previously added.

## Getting Started

## API
Currently no external API is needed (I believe).
